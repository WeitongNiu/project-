    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this project arises from the ongoing importance of wheat as a staple agricultural commodity, particularly in local markets such as Kansas. Numerous factors, including production levels, supply chain issues, weather, export-import dynamics, and local consumption patterns, influence wheat pricing. As wheat production plays a crucial role in Kansas state's local crop economies, understanding the microeconomic factors behind its pricing and market behavior is critical for optimizing and efficient decision-making by local farmers, policymakers, and businesses like demand, supply, equilibrium price, and quantity trend forecast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our team is interested in understanding how local factors, such as environmental and weather conditions, Market Structure (wheat should ), production efficiency (technology ex), and trade policies (tariffs and tax ex), affect wheat prices in Kansas (we may only focus on a few of them). In recent years, fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices have led to significant economic consequences for both producers and consumers in the region. By exploring these local dynamics, we will strive to provide valuable insights that could help mitigate risks associated with price volatility and optimize agricultural practices in the region. We are also interested in the seasonal trend of the price of wheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a broader understanding of the agricultural markets in Kansas (ex-test if the model fits more generally), which can potentially be applied to other regions with similar economic and agricultural structures. Furthermore, this study aligns with current trends in using microeconomic theory to analyze agricultural markets and predict future market behaviors, particularly in the context of policy changes or shifts in production patterns due to supply and demand shifts together with elasticity and so on."

    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Questions**:\n",
    "  - How do local factors, such as production levels and stocks, weather factors including rainfall and temperature, imports, and exports, influence wheat prices in Kansas? How are these variables correlated?\n",
    "  - What are the key determinants of wheat supply and demand in Kansas's wheat market? I.e. except for sales and production, what other factors matter to my model?\n",
    "  - Can we identify significant trends in wheat pricing and market behavior based on historical data?\n",
    "  - How do we interpolate or adjust annual production data to obtain monthly or seasonal production data to match prices (Most reports and data are annual)?\n",
    "   - How to do the missing sales in 2024 or other data influence the trend in regression? How to fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Objectives**:\n",
    "  - Develop expertise in applying microeconomic concepts, such as supply (supply shock) and demand estimation models, market equilibrium distributions (maybe parametric or nonparametric), and price elasticity, to an agricultural market context.\n",
    "  - Gain experience in working with time series data :(optional: Brownian motion (BM) (need to decompose, helpful for price volatility as diffusion matrix), exponential smoothing, ARIMA, including understanding seasonal trends and their impact on pricing to provide the approximate distribution type for regression (hopefully linear) and visualization.\n",
    "  - Understand the role of local market dynamics within broader national and global agricultural trade systems (especially Kansas, which has the highest wheat production in the United States).\n",
    "  - Learn how to conduct data cleaning and preparation (including quarterly stock info, not montly), do exploratory analysis, and develop forecasting models using historical agricultural data.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We anticipate several data-cleaning tasks, including:\n",
    "- Handling missing values and unmatched index: Date attributes need to be handled. Some rows may have missing values after matching the date and incomplete data (especially in production for supply and stock as quarterly data). Plan to add annual production evenly for each month and may add random erros & seasonal trends from other reports (like in USDA) initially. After forecasting supply, we will adjust it more accurately by predicting value from regression, for example. We plan to impute missing values using the average of (mean of the corresponding month from previous years and the mean of the corresponding year's sales) (done)\n",
    "- Ensuring consistent formatting: The dataset may have inconsistent units (e.g., tons vs. bushels) and inconsistent dates. We will standardize units across all observations and match the date like using (1) reverse the order of the dates (2) .groupby and order month. Observed all are good up till now.\n",
    "- Aggregating data: We may need to aggregate quarterly data or monthly to yearly summaries to simplify analysis and remove noise from seasonal fluctuations (actually, I can download all annual data for 100 years, but may adjust by price inflation and other effects). (aggregate in heatmap)\n",
    "- Adding more price factors' data to the df_kansasdata_1_copy_1.\n",
    "Additionally, we plan to create new features such as (not done yet, will be finished in analysis of mkt dynamics):\n",
    "- Adjusted production values (taking into account inflation or market conditions) after time series analysis and/ or regression\n",
    "- price elasticity of demand by definition (percentage change in quantity-demanded (sales)/ percentage change in price)\n",
    "- Maybe add marginal quantities like marginal product\n",
    "- Price indices are based on supply-demand relationships in the dataset (there are indices summaries from the national level).\n",
    "- Note that the price trend may be similar to the national level, considering the high production of Kansas, but the supply and demand are estimated locally. https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Lite/result.php?35CB4797-7F2C-3203-912F-B769E7867F50 production2"

    "\n",
    "- **Stakeholders**:\n",
    "  - Local farmers and wheat producers in Kanas could benefit from a better understanding of price fluctuations and market trends.\n",
    "  - Policymakers and agricultural economists in the region may use the findings to optimize local agricultural policies and programs.\n",
    "  - Consumers in Kanas and the broader region who are affected by changes in wheat prices might be indirectly impacted by more stable pricing or improved market efficiencies due to Kanas's high wheat production in the US.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Potential Harm**:\n",
    "    -   While this analysis focuses on publicly available historical data and does not include any personal or sensitive information, there is still the potential for misinterpretation of the results. More specifically, if the findings were used to make broad assumptions about the future with imperfect or incomplete market dynamics analysis, it could mislead stakeholders, leading to surplus (excess supply) or shortage (excess demand). Additionally, large sample sizes and advanced hypothesis tests may create P-hacking or other statistical 'errors' like bias and minuses from multiple models and evaluation methods. However, ethical risks are minimal since the data is aggregated and does not contain any identifiable personal information. (One of the reasons that the budget constraint curve in utility maximization to estimate demand, and the total cost line for cost-minimizing is difficult to assess (less data) is ethical harm to the privacy of firms & individuals and potential misuses of models)\n",
    "    -   Econml model depends on the data we have, our model still lakcs lots of external factors that is hard to get. So the quantified relationship is possible not reliable but may show brief understanding\n"

Implementing basic supply-demand models using regression (optional: cost minimizing and utility maximizing) to understand how fluctuations in supply (production) and demand (consumption like sales, exports) influence prices. Ex, some policies may shift supply curve... (Econ 2010/4010) (future). 2. And price elasticity analysis can help understanding sensivity of the previous models (to max profit ex). We may need to search for additional knowledge to evaluate. \n",

Future: Note that **PCA and other reduce dimension method** may be helpful in choosing factors to predict price, demand, and supply curves. Also, neural network may work to determine relationship and importance of different factors, may use stochatic process knowledge for equilibrium weights chaning.
